# Data Exploration and Cleaning realized:

- The original datasets were used to create new datasets with only the features chosen as described above;
- The new datasets were explored and the following changes were made:
  - Duplicated rows were deleted;
  - Rows with empty cells were deleted;
  - Rows with nonsensical data(such as negative Prices or Areas) were deleted;
- Outliers were Removed using the following algorithms(all were implemented and after further analysis only one will be chosen):
  - IQR score.
  - Grubbs test.
  - Zscore.
  
- With these changes the dataset ec_properties.csv was completely removed because it had less than 1000 data points.
- Plots were created for each dataset representing the differences before and after outlier removal with each algorithm.
